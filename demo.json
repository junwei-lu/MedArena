Pertinent Results:ADMISSION LABS:DISCHARGE LABS:IMAGING STUDIES:FINDINGS: Ultrasound evaluation of the right groin demonstrates a cysticstructure with swirling flow consistent with pseudoaneurysm. The neckmeasures approximately 5 mm. The pseudoaneurysm measures 2.1 x 1.2 cm. IMPRESSION: Findings in the right groin are consistent with pseudoaneurysm.--------------Femoral Vascular US R ___:FINDINGS: The right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm is completely thrombosedand demonstrates no flow on color Doppler ultrasound. The right commonfemoral artery and vein are patent. The superficial femoral artery and veinsare also unremarkable. IMPRESSION:1. Thrombosed right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.2. Patent right common and superficial femoral arteries and veins. Brief Hospital Course:This is a ___ year old female with uterine fibroid embolization on ___ who presented with right groin pain and swelling determined by ultrasound to be a pseudoaneurysm.1) Pseudoaneurysm: Patient presented with psuedoaneurysm confirmed by ultrasound that was secondary to her recent uterine fibroid embolization on ___. On ___ patient underwent psuedoaneurysm thrombin injection. Ultrasound on ___ indicated pseudoaneurysm had been thrombosed with remaining femoral artery patent. A repeat US on ___ prior to discharge also demonstrated thrombosed right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm and patent right common and superficial femoral arteries and veins. Following thrombin injection patient experienced right groin pain. She also experienced pain in her pelvic region thought to be secondary to fibroids responding to embolization procedure. Pain initially treated with intravenous morphine and transitioned to oral oxycodone at time of discharge. She was given a prescription for oxycodone 5mg ___ tabs TID as needed for pain. She was instructed not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking this medication. She was also prescribed ibuprofen 800 mg PO TID to reduce inflammation and instructed to take this medication with food and water.

Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO three times a day as needed for pain.Disp:*18 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* Discharge Disposition:Home Discharge Diagnosis:Primary: Right groin pseudoaneurysmSecondary: Rheumatoid arthritis Discharge Condition:good Discharge Instructions:You came to the emergency department because you were having severe right sided groin pain. In the ED it was determined that you had a right sided pseudoaneurysm that was likely caused by your recent uterine artery embolization. Interventional radiology performed a thrombin injection into your pseudoaneurysm. Following this procedure you had considerable pain at both your right groin site and in your pelvic region. This pelvic pain is likely from the regression of your fibroids. We treated your pain with IV pain medication and anti-inflammatory medication. Prior to discharge we transitioned you to oral pain medication which appropriately addressed your pain.You had constipation during your admission though you do have baseline irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. We had you on a bowel regimen consisting of senna, colace, lactulose and biscadoyl suppository. You did not have a bowel movement during your hospitalization which we attribute to the fact that you have constipation at baseline, received narcotics from pain control, have not physically been moving since your procedure and have consumed a limited diet. We are discharging you with senna, colace and lactulose. If you do not have a bowel movement in the next ___ hrs you could try using a Fleet enema, which you noted you use at home sometimes, or contact your primary care physician.You were started on the following new medications:**Ibuprofen 800 mg by mouth every 8 hours: This medication reduces inflammation and should help with your pain. Always take this medication with food and water since it can cause stomach irritation.**Oxycodone 5mg-10 mg by mouth three times per day as needed for pain. This medication is for pain control. It can cause constipation so you may need to take a stool softener Do not drive or operate heavy machinery when taking this medication.**Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily as needed for constipation**Senna 1 tab daily as needed for constipation**Lactulose 30mL by mouth twice a day as needed for constipationFollow up as per below.If you develop increasing pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, increased swelling in your right groin, chest pain or shortness of breath please call your primary care provider or go to the emergency department for evaluation.",

There is mild septal deviation to the left. The aortia is of normal caliber. There is no lymphadenopathy. The major airways are patent. There are grounglass opacities in the left upper lobe. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is mild bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis, scarring. Impression:Positive for pulmonary emboli with large clot burden.Grounglass opacities in the left upper lobe, nonspecific, may be infectious/inflammatory or atypical pulmonary infarct.Echo ___:Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. IMPRESSION: Dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with abnormal septal motion suggestive of right ventricular pressure/volume overload (e.g. primary pulmonary process such as PE or COPD). Mildly dilated aortic root. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.Lower extremity Doppler US:Left deep venous thrombus within the proximal femoral vein extending to the popliteal vein, nonocclusive. Posterior tibial occlusive thrombus identified. Right popliteal deep venous non occlusive thrombus.  Brief Hospital Course:The patient is ___ year old male who presented with one day history of SOB found to have bilateral PE's at outside hospital, troponin of 0.32, sinus tachycardia on ECG, and right ventricular strain on Echo requiring transfer to CCU for thrombolysis.Bilateral Pulmonary Embolisms: Patient noted to have bilateral pulmonary embolism noted at outside hospital to have bilateral pulmonary embolism. The patient was transferred to the CCU for thrombolysis. The patient was started on tPA protocol as follows: tPA 10mg IV over 1 minute then 40mg over 2 hours with continued Unfractionated heparin at 1000u/hour with transition to weight based heparin until therapeutic. Following this, the patient was started on xarelto 15 mg BID on ___ for 3 weeks and then continued on 20 mg xarelto daily. Ambulating on 5L O2, he gets moderately SOB but mainatins O2 sat > 88%. He has been instructed to use O2 with any exertion. The etiology of the patient's pulmonary embolism and lower extremity DVT's was unclear but thought to be due to possible factor V leiden deficiency and other work up given family history in mother of recurrent DVT's as well as recurrent DVT's in father. Plan for outpatient follow up with Hem/Onc to address hypercoagulable work up with Factor V Leiden and antiphospholipid syndrome. Patient also with plan to follow up with Dr. ___ in ___ clinic. HypoxiaPatient's hypoxia and oxygen requirement thought to be secondary to bilateral pulmonary embolisms as above. The patient was discharged with home oxygen requirement for sleep and ambulation.Type II Diabetes with peripheral neuropathyPatient continued on ISS and daily lantus and humalog.

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF = 65%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area = 1.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen (may be underestimated). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen (may be underestimated). There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.  ___ CT CHEST  Although there are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, severe coronary calcification and sufficient aortic valvular calcification to produce aortic stenosis, the extremely asymmetric and non dependent distribution of the severe interstitial and alveolar abnormality, favoring the right lung and scattered elsewhere in the periphery of the left lung means that cardiogenic pulmonary edema is not a sufficient explanation for the severe lung findings although it may be contributory.   Differential diagnosis of the pulmonary abnormality includes severe viral infection, viral infection leading to diffuse alveolar damage, and acute interstitial pneumonia.  The large region of sparing in the left lower lobe argues against pneumocystis pneumonia, but certainly does not exclude that diagnosis. Severe generalized atherosclerotic calcification involves the head and neck vessels, particular the carotid arteries in addition to the coronaries. ___ CT CHEST:  1.  Slight interval improvement in persistent extensive pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, worst in the right upper lobe.  Differential diagnosis includes, as before, severe viral infection and acute interstitial pneumonia.  Chronic aspiration is possible as well. 2.  Posterior defect in the trachea is not currently seen and likely represented artifact on prior CT.  Confirmation of tracheoesophageal fistula would require barium swallow study under fluoroscopy.

The patient has remained profoundly hypoxemic despite broad abx coverage and diuresis, and he was found to have an elevated B-glucan and LDH, as well as NP swab positive for parainfluenza.Goals of care:  ___ wife was called on ___ by Dr. ___ ___ to discuss worsening respiratory status despite maximum intervention within the current goals of care with worsening metabolic state and agitation. Discussed that he has had ongoing treatment for pneumonia (PCP and viral pneumonia) and diuresis without improvement in his oxygenation and noted to have worsening O2 needs. Relayed that our hope has been to get him through his acute illness but that he is currently showing signs of deterioration in terms of his pulmonary function, mental status and electrolytes concerning for worsening disease process. Dr. ___ discussed with ___ family that we could continue to move forward with current care but the concern is that he is worsening and at risk of death. Also noted that he is more uncomfortable with rising oxygen needs. ___ wife spoke to her son and called back to confirm they would like to transition to comfort focused care. On ___, Dr. ___ met with the ___ wife and two sons at the ___ bedside to confirm their understanding of the severity of his illness and his wished for ongoing care. Patient unable to participate in discussion due to delirium. ___ wife and sons noted that they understood that he was worsening and \"dying\" and that they wanted to transition to comfort for the patient, per his prior wishes. We discussed the steps for this transition including medications to make his breathing more comfortable, help with agitation and delirium. The family was offered hospice services to help with coping but declined. All questions were answered. After this, his oxygen was removed and IV morphine drip was initiated for comfort.   Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure  Viral/HCAP/Multilobar/Interstitial Pneumonia Presented with persistent hypoxemia. CXR and CT scan suggested multifocal pneumonia most consistent with an atypical viral or bacterial etiology. CT showing diffuse asymmetric parenchymal changes c/w viral vs. interstitial pneumonia vs. alveolar hemorrhage with underlying volume overload possibly contributing as well. Because he was DNR/DNI, bronch was not able to pursued b/c would have compromised his already tenuous respiratory status. Initially started on vanc/zosyn for HCAP, steroids and Bactrim for possible PCP ___ (given recent steroid use), and resp viral panel came back positive for H flu. He did not improve on this regimen and still had substantial oxygen requirement. Duiresis was attempted without improvement in oxygenation. During his course developed worsening acidosis, hyponatremia, and altered mental status. He was unable to tolerate POs due to altered mental status, and it was confirmed with family that NGT/PEG were not in goals of care. In this setting he was transitioned to comfort care. On ___, MD called to bedside by RN at 00:10 for declining O2 saturations and bradycardia. Patient appeared comfortable taking shallow, intermittent respirations on morphine drip. Respiratory rate decreased and then ceased. Intermittent ectopy noted on telemetry then ceased and pulses were lost. Auscultated for breath sounds and cardiac sounds x1 minute with no activity. Pupillary response absent. No withdrawal to painful stimuli. Time of death 00:15. Cause of death: parainfluenza pneumonia. Family (son, ___ notified at 00:20 and expressed gratitude to ICU team. Autopsy was declined. Support offered to ___ family. Admitting office, overnight ICU attending (Dr. ___, NEOB (declined) and PCP (Dr. ___- answering service) notified.

She was initially admitted to the ICU and then transferred to the floor. Hypernatremia: She appeared to have hypovolemic hypernatremia based on clinical exam findings of dry mucous membranes, significant respiratory variation in IVC diameter, and IJ collapse with respiratory variation.  This is likely multifactorial in the setting of worsening mental status related to infection in combination with dementia. Pt was calculated to have a free water deficit of ~5L. Her hypernatremia was gradually corrected over the course of 2.5 days with ___ NS after volume resuscitation with LR.  Her sodium was monitored daily and remained within the normal range. Would continue to monitor weekly while at rehab and encourage liquid intake. HCAP: On presentation, pt had worsening mental status, leukocytosis, and CXR c/w possible left lower lobe PNA.  She had a new O2 requirement as well.  She was started on vanc, zosyn, and azythromycin. She completed an 8 day course on ___.  PICC was removed prior to discharge.  Over the course of her stay in the ICU, her O2 requirement resolved. At discharge she was afebrile, oxygen saturation in high ___ on room air breathing comfortably, some improving rhonchi at bases.  Nutrition/Goals of Care: It was suspected that her subacute weight loss is due to her dementia. She was seen by speach and swallow who provided diet recommendations. Also recent malnutrition due to acute illess. The issue of inadequate nutrition in patients with progressive dementia was discussed with her son ___. We dicussed adding high calorie supplements to her diet and asssitance with feeding. He will consider using an appetite stimulant with her outpatient providers. We discussed that there is no evidence that tube feeding will improve quality or longevity of life, which he recognized saying that he had dealt with similar issues with his father's chronic progressive illness and ultimately passing. DIET: Regular; Diabetic/Consistent Carbohydrate Consistency: Pureed (dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids Supplement: Glucerna shake breakfast, lunch, dinner pills crushed in puree. Aspiration precautions, please provide assistance with feeding.  HTN: Pt was mildly hypotensive on arrival and required volume resuscitation; metoprolol was therefore held. These were later restarted. Depression: she was continued on her home dose of 20mg citalopram. H/o CVA: She was continued on her home simva 20 and ASA 81.Anemia: Patient hematocrit trended down during hospitalization to 25. Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. Hematocrit remained stable at 25. Code status: Full code, although son ___ is HCP and reconsidering and would continue to address goals of careTRANSITIONAL: -monitor electrolytes (potassium, sodium)-monitor CBC for recovery of RBC count-add high calorie supplements to meals, assistance with feedings Medications on Admission:The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.1.

Chief Complaint:Fatigue. Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:None. History of Present Illness:___ with 3VD, DM, Alzheimer's who presented to ___ clinic today with two days of fatigue, malaise, dizziness, somnolence, and decreased PO intake. He was found by his PCP to be hypotensive with SBP 66 and sent to the ED.  .  Per OMR, the patient arrived to ___ in a wheelchair accompanied by his wife. Per wife, patient has been complaining of fatigue but no other symptoms. He was nauseous in parking lot but did not vomit. No recent fever, chills, syncope, cough, CP, SOB, abd pain, dysuria, or diarrhea. No recent med changes but he does take atenolol. The patient's wife administers his medications and does not recall giving extra dose for any reason. Reports glycemic control has been normal.  .  In the ED, initial vs were: 97.4 70 78/53 16 98% RA. Clinically dry on exam. Labs notable for creatinine of 1.8, lipase of 146, HCT 33 (baseline 36). EKG - nsr, <1mm STE V1-v3: no sig change prior. Will add on troponin. CXR was unremarkable. U/A not done. Patient was given 2L IVF and his SBP has remained >110. VS on transfer: HR 69 BP ___ 100% on R. For access patient20g in right arm and 18 gauge in right EJ.  .  On the floor, the patient is pleasantly demented and eating dinner. He reports that he feels completely better after the IVF and again denies any CP, SOB, nausea, vomiting. He initially stated that he had an episode of diarrhea at some point and then states maybe he has been constipated.   Past Medical History:TYPE 2 DIABETES  HYPERTENSION  HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA  DEMENTIA (likely multi-infarct)  DEPRESSION  ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION  GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX  BACK PAIN  HEARING LOSS  FALLS  known CAD- 3VD, without intervention  Chronic Renal Insufficency- ___ to DM2 and HTN  benign distal esophageal stricture  s/p left carotid stent  s/p groin stent  s/p left nephrectomy for benign kidney tumor   Social History:___Family History:His brother had a heart attack @ ___.  There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.  Physical Exam:Upon admission: General: Alert, no acute distress eating a sandwich  HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM,  Neck: supple,  Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally,  CV: Regular rate and rhythm,  Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly  Skin: Well demarcated round hyperpigmented lesions on palms, no other rash.  Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, dry skin over backs of hands and lower legs  Neuro: CNs2-12 intact, A&O x1 (self), answers questions appropriately but promptly forgets conversation.  . At discharge: gen: pleasant male in NAD  HEENT: anicteric, MMM  CV: CXR: The lungs are clear bilaterally with no areas of focal consolidation. Previously seen pleural plaque is again noted at the right lung base. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is prominence of the ascending aorta which likely represents post-stenotic dilation from aortic stenosis. The aorta is also mildly tortuous but unchanged. Heart size is normal. Multiple clips are again noted in the left upper quadrant. IMPRESSION: EKG: Sinus rhythm. Normal ECG. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there is no significant change.  Brief Hospital Course:___ year old male with multi-infarct dementia who presents with lethargy and hypotension found to have acute renal failure, all of which was responsive to IV hydration.  .   Hypotension: Patient's only localizing symptom is nausea without vomiting, diarrhea, fever or leukocytosis so infection is unlikely. A normal random cortisol ruled out adrenal insufficiency.  Urine and blood cultures were negative.  Most likely etiology is poor PO intake in the setting of anti-hypertensives.  He was hypertensive during the remainder of his stay.  His isosorbide and lisinopril were initially held but restarted.  His atenolol was held until he sees his PCP in follow up.  .   Poor PO intake: Patient reported nausea last night without abdominal pain. He is asymptomatic, and ate three full meals while admitted. Labs on admission revealed a mildly elevated lipase with normal LFT's and white count.  ACS was unlikely given 3 days of symptoms and troponin is <0.1.  Urine and blood cultures were negative.  Most likely secondary to hypoglycemia prior to eating. .   Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine elevated on admission to 1.8, downtrending after IVF overnight to 1.5. Baseline creatinine is 1.2. Likely prerenal due to poor PO intake over the past few days and his positive response to fluid challenge.  His atenolol was held accordingly..   Rash on Palms: Unclear from notes how long this has been present. Patient had a negative RPR in ___, and unlikely to have developed syphilis since then. RPR negative.  .   Anemia: Hematocrit at baseline this morning.  Iron studies, B12 and folate were within normal limits..   CAD: Patient has known 3VD that is not able to be intervened on. Patient denies chest pain and cardiac enzymes negative x2.  He was continued on plavix, aspirin, statin, isosorbide and his ACE.  His atenolol was held given ___..   Hypertension: He was hypertensive during admission as his atenolol was held in the setting of ___.  He was restarted on isosorbide and his ACE on the second day of admission.  He was advised to hold his atenolol until he saw his PCP..   Type 2 DM, on oral hypoglycemics:  His glipizide and metformin were held while admitted and he was covered with sliding scale insulin. .
