In the ED it was determined that \nyou had a right sided pseudoaneurysm that was likely caused by \nyour recent uterine artery embolization. Interventional \nradiology performed a thrombin injection into your \npseudoaneurysm. Following this procedure you had considerable \npain at both your right groin site and in your pelvic region. \nThis pelvic pain is likely from the regression of your fibroids. \nWe treated your pain with IV pain medication and \nanti-inflammatory medication. Prior to discharge we transitioned \nyou to oral pain medication which appropriately addressed your \npain.\n\nYou had constipation during your admission though you do have \nbaseline irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. We had you \non a bowel regimen consisting of senna, colace, lactulose and \nbiscadoyl suppository. You did not have a bowel movement during \nyour hospitalization which we attribute to the fact that you \nhave constipation at baseline, received narcotics from pain \ncontrol, have not physically been moving since your procedure \nand have consumed a limited diet. We are discharging you with \nsenna, colace and lactulose. If you do not have a bowel movement \nin the next ___ hrs you could try using a Fleet enema, which \nyou noted you use at home sometimes, or contact your primary \ncare physician.\n\nYou were started on the following new medications:\n**Ibuprofen 800 mg by mouth every 8 hours: This medication \nreduces inflammation and should help with your pain. Always take \nthis medication with food and water since it can cause stomach \nirritation.\n**Oxycodone 5mg-10 mg by mouth three times per day as needed for \npain. This medication is for pain control. It can cause \nconstipation so you may need to take a stool softener Do not \ndrive or operate heavy machinery when taking this medication.\n**Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily as needed for constipation\n**Senna 1 tab daily as needed for constipation\n**Lactulose 30mL by mouth twice a day as needed for constipation\n\nFollow up as per below.\n\nIf you develop increasing pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, \nincreased swelling in your right groin, chest pain or shortness \nof breath please call your primary care provider or go to the \nemergency department for evaluation.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n",

She was initially \nadmitted to the ICU and then transferred to the floor.\n\n#####   Hypernatremia: She appeared to have hypovolemic hypernatremia \nbased on clinical exam findings of dry mucous membranes, \nsignificant respiratory variation in IVC diameter, and IJ \ncollapse with respiratory variation.  This is likely \nmultifactorial in the setting of worsening mental status related \nto infection in combination with dementia. Pt was calculated to \nhave a free water deficit of ~5L. Her hypernatremia was \ngradually corrected over the course of 2.5 days with ___ NS \nafter volume resuscitation with LR.  Her sodium was monitored \ndaily and remained within the normal range. Would continue to \nmonitor weekly while at rehab and encourage liquid intake.\n\n#####   HCAP: On presentation, pt had worsening mental status, \nleukocytosis, and CXR c/w possible left lower lobe PNA.  She had \na new O2 requirement as well.  She was started on vanc, zosyn, \nand azythromycin. She completed an 8 day course on ___.  \nPICC was removed prior to discharge.  Over the course of her \nstay in the ICU, her O2 requirement resolved. At discharge she \nwas afebrile, oxygen saturation in high ___ on room air \nbreathing comfortably, some improving rhonchi at bases. \n\n#####   Nutrition/Goals of Care: It was suspected that her subacute \nweight loss is due to her dementia. She was seen by speach and \nswallow who provided diet recommendations. Also recent \nmalnutrition due to acute illess. The issue of inadequate \nnutrition in patients with progressive dementia was discussed \nwith her son ___. We dicussed adding high calorie supplements \nto her diet and asssitance with feeding. He will consider using \nan appetite stimulant with her outpatient providers. We \ndiscussed that there is no evidence that tube feeding will \nimprove quality or longevity of life, which he recognized saying \nthat he had dealt with similar issues with his father's chronic \nprogressive illness and ultimately passing. \nDIET: \nRegular; Diabetic/Consistent Carbohydrate Consistency: Pureed \n(dysphagia); Nectar prethickened liquids Supplement: Glucerna \nshake breakfast, lunch, dinner pills crushed in puree. \nAspiration precautions, please provide assistance with feeding. \n\n#####   HTN: Pt was mildly hypotensive on arrival and required volume \nresuscitation; metoprolol was therefore held. These were later \nrestarted.\n\n#####   Depression: she was continued on her home dose of 20mg \ncitalopram.\n\n#####   H/o CVA: She was continued on her home simva 20 and ASA 81.\n\n#####  Anemia: Patient hematocrit trended down during hospitalization \nto 25. Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation. \nHematocrit remained stable at 25. \n\nCode status: Full code, although son ___ is HCP and \nreconsidering and would continue to address goals of care\n\nTRANSITIONAL: \n-monitor electrolytes (potassium, sodium)\n-monitor CBC for recovery of RBC count\n-add high calorie supplements to meals, assistance with feedings\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

A normal random cortisol ruled out adrenal \ninsufficiency.  Urine and blood cultures were negative.  Most \nlikely etiology is poor PO intake in the setting of \nanti-hypertensives.  He was hypertensive during the remainder of \nhis stay.  His isosorbide and lisinopril were initially held but \nrestarted.  His atenolol was held until he sees his PCP in \nfollow up.  \n.  \n#####   Poor PO intake: Patient reported nausea last night without \nabdominal pain. He is asymptomatic, and ate three full meals \nwhile admitted. Labs on admission revealed a mildly elevated \nlipase with normal LFT's and white count.  ACS was unlikely \ngiven 3 days of symptoms and troponin is <0.1.  Urine and blood \ncultures were negative.  Most likely secondary to hypoglycemia \nprior to eating. \n.  \n#####   Acute on chronic renal failure: Creatinine elevated on \nadmission to 1.8, downtrending after IVF overnight to 1.5. \nBaseline creatinine is 1.2. Likely prerenal due to poor PO \nintake over the past few days and his positive response to fluid \nchallenge.  His atenolol was held accordingly.\n.  \n#####   Rash on Palms: Unclear from notes how long this has been \npresent. Patient had a negative RPR in ___, and unlikely to \nhave developed syphilis since then. RPR negative.  \n.  \n#####   Anemia: Hematocrit at baseline this morning.  Iron studies, \nB12 and folate were within normal limits.\n.  \n#####   CAD: Patient has known 3VD that is not able to be intervened \non. Patient denies chest pain and cardiac enzymes negative x2.  \nHe was continued on plavix, aspirin, statin, isosorbide and his \nACE.  His atenolol was held given ___.\n.  \n#####   Hypertension: He was hypertensive during admission as his \natenolol was held in the setting of ___.  He was restarted on \nisosorbide and his ACE on the second day of admission.  He was \nadvised to hold his atenolol until he saw his PCP.\n.  \n#####   Type 2 DM, on oral hypoglycemics:  His glipizide and metformin \nwere held while admitted and he was covered with sliding scale \ninsulin. \n.  \n#####   Multi-infarct vs. Alzhemier's dementia:  Stable.  He was \ncontinued on his home dose Namenda and galantamine.  \n.  \n#####   GERD: His dose of Ranitidine was reduced given ARF during \nadmission. \n.\n#####   Depression: Mood appropriate.

There is mild septal deviation \nto the left. The aortia is of normal caliber. There is no \nlymphadenopathy. The major airways are patent. There are \ngrounglass opacities in the left upper lobe. There is no pleural \neffusion or pneumothorax. There is mild bibasilar subsegmental \natelectasis, scarring. \n\nImpression:\nPositive for pulmonary emboli with large clot burden.\nGrounglass opacities in the left upper lobe, nonspecific, may be \ninfectious/inflammatory or atypical pulmonary infarct.\n\nEcho ___:\nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global \nsystolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular \ncavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There \nis abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right \nventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly \ndilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened (?#####  ). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic \nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly \nthickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within \nnormal limits). There is severe pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an \nanterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. \n\n\nIMPRESSION: Dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with abnormal \nseptal motion suggestive of right ventricular pressure/volume \noverload (e.g. primary pulmonary process such as PE or COPD). \nMildly dilated aortic root. Severe pulmonary artery systolic \nhypertension.\n\nLower extremity Doppler US:\nLeft deep venous thrombus within the proximal femoral vein \nextending to \nthe popliteal vein, nonocclusive. Posterior tibial occlusive \nthrombus \nidentified. Right popliteal deep venous non occlusive thrombus. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is ___ year old male who presented with one day \nhistory of SOB found to have bilateral PE's at outside hospital, \ntroponin of 0.32, sinus tachycardia on ECG, and right \nventricular strain on Echo requiring transfer to CCU for \nthrombolysis.\n\n#####  Bilateral Pulmonary Embolisms: \nPatient noted to have bilateral pulmonary embolism noted at \noutside hospital to have bilateral pulmonary embolism. The \npatient was transferred to the CCU for thrombolysis. The patient \nwas started on tPA protocol as follows: tPA 10mg IV over 1 \nminute then 40mg over 2 hours with continued Unfractionated \nheparin at 1000u/hour with transition to weight based heparin \nuntil therapeutic. Following this, the patient was started on \nxarelto 15 mg BID on ___ for 3 weeks and then continued on \n20 mg xarelto daily. Ambulating on 5L O2, he gets moderately SOB \nbut mainatins O2 sat > 88%. He has been instructed to use O2 \nwith any exertion. The etiology of the patient's pulmonary \nembolism and lower extremity DVT's was unclear but thought to be \ndue to possible factor V leiden deficiency and other work up \ngiven family history in mother of recurrent DVT's as well as \nrecurrent DVT's in father. Plan for outpatient follow up with \nHem/Onc to address hypercoagulable work up with Factor V Leiden \nand antiphospholipid syndrome.
