Pertinent Results:ADMISSION LABS:DISCHARGE LABS:IMAGING STUDIES:FINDINGS: Ultrasound evaluation of the right groin demonstrates a cysticstructure with swirling flow consistent with pseudoaneurysm. The neckmeasures approximately 5 mm. The pseudoaneurysm measures 2.1 x 1.2 cm. IMPRESSION: Findings in the right groin are consistent with pseudoaneurysm.--------------Femoral Vascular US R ___:FINDINGS: The right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm is completely thrombosedand demonstrates no flow on color Doppler ultrasound. The right commonfemoral artery and vein are patent. The superficial femoral artery and veinsare also unremarkable. IMPRESSION:1. Thrombosed right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.2. Patent right common and superficial femoral arteries and veins. Brief Hospital Course:This is a ___ year old female with uterine fibroid embolization on ___ who presented with right groin pain and swelling determined by ultrasound to be a pseudoaneurysm.1) Pseudoaneurysm: Patient presented with psuedoaneurysm confirmed by ultrasound that was secondary to her recent uterine fibroid embolization on ___. On ___ patient underwent psuedoaneurysm thrombin injection. Ultrasound on ___ indicated pseudoaneurysm had been thrombosed with remaining femoral artery patent. A repeat US on ___ prior to discharge also demonstrated thrombosed right femoral artery pseudoaneurysm and patent right common and superficial femoral arteries and veins. Following thrombin injection patient experienced right groin pain. She also experienced pain in her pelvic region thought to be secondary to fibroids responding to embolization procedure. Pain initially treated with intravenous morphine and transitioned to oral oxycodone at time of discharge. She was given a prescription for oxycodone 5mg ___ tabs TID as needed for pain. She was instructed not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking this medication. She was also prescribed ibuprofen 800 mg PO TID to reduce inflammation and instructed to take this medication with food and water. Post-procedure follow up to be arranged by ___, interventional radiology ___.2) Constipation: Patient experienced constipation during this admission. Last bowel movement day prior to admission. Patient reports that she has irritable bowel syndrome with constipation at baseline. Likely constipation worsened due to patient taking narcotics for pain control. Patient started on bowel regimen including colace, senna and lactulose. Patient was discharged with a prescription for oral lactulose. She will contact her primary care physician if she is unable to have a bowel movement within ___ hours of discharge.  3)Rheumatoid Arthritis:Stable during this admission. Patient was continued on outpatient regimen of prednisone and folate. Patient had taken weekly dose of methotrexate prior to admission. Medications on Admission:1. Prednisone 5mg QDAY2. Folate 1 mg QDAY3. Methotrexate 10mg Q wk4. Culturale (probiotic) daily Discharge Medications:1. Prednisone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  2.

Oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: ___ Tablets PO three times a day as needed for pain.Disp:*18 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0* Discharge Disposition:Home Discharge Diagnosis:Primary: Right groin pseudoaneurysmSecondary: Rheumatoid arthritis Discharge Condition:good Discharge Instructions:You came to the emergency department because you were having severe right sided groin pain. In the ED it was determined that you had a right sided pseudoaneurysm that was likely caused by your recent uterine artery embolization. Interventional radiology performed a thrombin injection into your pseudoaneurysm. Following this procedure you had considerable pain at both your right groin site and in your pelvic region. This pelvic pain is likely from the regression of your fibroids. We treated your pain with IV pain medication and anti-inflammatory medication. Prior to discharge we transitioned you to oral pain medication which appropriately addressed your pain.You had constipation during your admission though you do have baseline irritable bowel syndrome with constipation. We had you on a bowel regimen consisting of senna, colace, lactulose and biscadoyl suppository. You did not have a bowel movement during your hospitalization which we attribute to the fact that you have constipation at baseline, received narcotics from pain control, have not physically been moving since your procedure and have consumed a limited diet. We are discharging you with senna, colace and lactulose. If you do not have a bowel movement in the next ___ hrs you could try using a Fleet enema, which you noted you use at home sometimes, or contact your primary care physician.You were started on the following new medications:**Ibuprofen 800 mg by mouth every 8 hours: This medication reduces inflammation and should help with your pain. Always take this medication with food and water since it can cause stomach irritation.**Oxycodone 5mg-10 mg by mouth three times per day as needed for pain. This medication is for pain control. It can cause constipation so you may need to take a stool softener Do not drive or operate heavy machinery when taking this medication.**Colace 100 mg by mouth twice daily as needed for constipation**Senna 1 tab daily as needed for constipation**Lactulose 30mL by mouth twice a day as needed for constipationFollow up as per below.If you develop increasing pain, fevers, chills, night sweats, increased swelling in your right groin, chest pain or shortness of breath please call your primary care provider or go to the emergency department for evaluation.",

LENIs showed DVT after which the patient was transferred to ___. In the ED, initial VS 98.1, 84, 142/65, 16, 98% RA.  Initial labs were unremarkable.   CXR here showed no evidence of PNA.  UA was grossly positive and the patient was given IV ceftriaxone, Lovenox 70 mg x 1 prior to transfer.Of note, the patient was most recently discharged from ___ in ___ for seizure activity and was found to have a 3 cm atypical meningioma. Per ___ discussion with the patient's niece, surgical intervention was deferred.  Her course at the time was also notable for new paroxysmal AFib; given her CHADSVASC score of 4, anticoagulation was warranted.  However, given her age, risk of fall, and her new intracranial lesion (high risk for venous bleed), anticoagulation was deferred.
